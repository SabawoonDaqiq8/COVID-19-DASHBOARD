<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](screenshots/screenshot-dashboard.png)

There are many great COVID-19 Dashboards available on GitHub. I created this one for a project of mine for a job interview. I want to create a COVID-19 Dashboard so amazing that it will be the best one among the candidates.

Of course, this dashboard isn't complete and needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

This Dashboard is developed using [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [Fuse UI Template](http://angular-material.fusetheme.com/dashboards/project).

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
* [AmCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/)

* [FakeDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fake-db)
